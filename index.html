<!-- In the style tag, we have five selectors. The html tag has a lightBlue background color overall, black text, and is in TNR. The h3:hover tag is used only when hovering over any of the h3 header tags, and it makes it red. The h1 tag aligns the text to the center and has a shadow for my name. The img selector has a white background in between the border, which is double, and then there is a black shadow at the bottom of the image. The footer selector is just moved 200 px to the right -->

<h3>Where I was born</h3>
    I was born and raised right here in Chicago. The world was blessed with me on February 26th, 2000. It wa in the Northwestern Hospital, too! 

<h3>Friends in Elementary School</h3>
    My friends came from everywhere. I went to the Lycee, and a lot of the kids had parents who were constantly bouncing around because of work. My best friedn, August, left for Austria in second grade and I was really sad. We used to play Pokemon all the time together, especially HearGold and SoulSilver. Shout out to Buizel.

<h3>Future Plans</h3>
    Peep me at Nike in ten years, running the marketing department. Or, I could also be 
        designing my own models. Tinket Hatfield 2.0 in the flesh.

<h3>Three Adjectives</h3>
    Big<br>Fucking<br>Nasty

<h3>Favorite Subjects</h3>
    My favorite subjects are Economics and Jazz Band. We get lit.

<h3>Hobbies/Activities</h3>
    Outside of school I do a couple of things. 
    <ul>
        <li>Trumpet 
        <li>Soccer
        <li>Skiing
        <li>French
    </ul>

<h3>Physical Goal</h3>
    I actually don't really have any physical goals. If I could grow an inch that would be cool because I would finally be over 6 ft. The longer I stay in bed, the more I grow.

<h3>Emotional Goal</h3>
    I am going to try to be more understadning that some people are dumb. I get pressed pretty quickly; not good.  

<h3>Social Goal</h3>
    I want to get to know more of my fellow seniors! I feel like I know a decent amount of them, but it would be cool to know more of them.
